This section provides a variety of examples to help you get started with FastCSV.

While FastCSV is compatible with Java 17 and later, the examples in this section use
Java 24 to demonstrate modern Java features and syntax for the sake of brevity.

You find all source code examples in the [FastCSV GitHub repository](https://github.com/osiegmar/FastCSV/tree/main/example/src/main/java/example).
