The typical way to read CSV data with FastCSV is to use one of the `CsvReaderBuilder` methods `ofCsvRecord()` or `ofNamedCsvRecord()`.
These methods provide convenient access to CSV data as a stream of `CsvRecord` or `NamedCsvRecord` objects.

Under the hood, FastCSV uses a callback handler to process CSV data and create the objects that represent each CSV record.
The callback handlers `CsvRecordHandler` and `NamedCsvRecordHandler` back the convenience methods `ofCsvRecord()` and `ofNamedCsvRecord()`.

FastCSV also provides the `StringArrayHandler` (see [Reading as String Arrays](/guides/examples/reading-as-string-array/)),
which allows you to read CSV data as string arrays directly.

If none of the built-in callback handlers meets your requirements, you can implement your own custom callback handler.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to read CSV data using a custom callback handler. This allows you to
process the CSV data in a more flexible way.
