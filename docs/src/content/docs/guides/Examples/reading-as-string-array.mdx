title: Reading as String Arrays

The typical way to read CSV data with FastCSV is to use one of the `CsvReaderBuilder` methods `ofCsvRecord()` or `ofNamedCsvRecord()`.
These methods provide convenient access to CSV data as a stream of `CsvRecord` or `NamedCsvRecord` objects.

Under the hood, FastCSV uses a callback handler to process CSV data and create the objects that represent each CSV record.
The callback handlers `CsvRecordHandler` and `NamedCsvRecordHandler` back the convenience methods `ofCsvRecord()` and `ofNamedCsvRecord()`.

Although `CsvRecord` and `NamedCsvRecord` are convenient, they introduce some overhead because they are designed as immutable objects that
encapsulate the read CSV data and provide access only through unmodifiable lists or maps.
This overhead is usually negligible, but if object allocation becomes a bottleneck, and you prefer not to implement a
[custom callback handler](/guides/examples/custom-callback-handler/), FastCSV offers the built-in `StringArrayHandler`.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to read CSV data as string arrays.
